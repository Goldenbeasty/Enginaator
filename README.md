###[Enginaator](https://www.enginaator.ee) 2021 code soulution in mechatronics stamina

All this code is written for a Arduino Leonardo using PlatformIO in VScode.
Despite git history all of the code is written my me ([Goldenbeasty](https://github.com/Goldenbeasty)), big thanks to [PilotMV](https://github.com/PilotMV) for allowing me to use his comuter during the tasks. ♥️

We didn't notice the end part of the second task and didn't code it :( losing lot's of points.
There is a bug in the third task in witch the robot does not move past the third station for some reason.

Big thanks to the organizers of Enginaator for providing an incredible experience!
